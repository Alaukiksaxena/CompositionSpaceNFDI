# Possible test dataset:
- [x] [teaching data in paraprobe repository](https://gitlab.com/mdforti/paraprobe-toolbox/-/blob/main/teaching/example_data/usa_portland_wang/usa_portland_wang.tar.gz): Added data to `tests/data` folder. Now used in tests.

# how to start testing
- [x] readpos file function
