**The archive file 636402001.nxs.zip contains both files (using the NeXus/HDF5 data structure) with which to run**
**the refactored version of the CompositionSpace tool that was implemented via the nexus-io feature branch.**

The files contained therein were created by running the transcoder and ranger tool from the paraprobe-toolbox
on the usa_portland_wang training material of the [paraprobe-toolbox](https://www.gitlab.com/paraprobe/paraprobe-toolbox).
